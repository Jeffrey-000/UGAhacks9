Purpose:
 - The purpose of our chrome extension is to help the user decide whether or not a meal delivery service is worth the price. The main functionality is to compare the full price at checkout with the price of similar items at that chain's location. Additional functionality, such as the time to walk to the location, the elevation change, calories in the meal, and estimated calories to walk may help the user make their decision.
