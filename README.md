Purpose:
 - To allow users to post times they are willing to volunteer, along with information such as their skillset, contact information, and restrictions on what kinds of work they don't want to do. This allows both organizations like charities and companies, as well as individuals, to seek out volunteers. The volunteer can then choose to accept the work based on the description given. After the work is complete, the party who requested the service can give a rating to the volunteer, based on whether they showed up and completed their end. Likewise, volunteers can give ratings to requesters based on how reasonable their requests were. This, along with initial identity verification and contact info, help ensure the trustworthiness of both parties.
